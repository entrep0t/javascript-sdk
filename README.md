# Entrepot

Entrepot SDK for Node &amp; the browser ðŸš€


## Installation

```
yarn add entrepot-sdk
```

### Optional dependencies

As this sdk relies on `fetch`, we added `isomorphic-fetch` as an optional dependency and strongly suggest adding it to your project or polyfill the `fetch` utility using your own method if necessary.


## Usage

```javascript
import { setConfig, getProducts } from 'entrepot-sdk';

setConfig({ clientId: 'yourClientId' });
getProducts().then(products => console.log(products));
```

## IE Compatibility

As part of a global effort to deprecate Internet Explorer, we decided not to include IE polyfills by default.
You can still manually import a version containing all the necessary polyfills for IE >= 11:

```javascript
import * as entrepot from 'entrepot-sdk/dist/ie/entrepot.esm.js';
```

Please note that this build will probably add more than 150kb to your final bundle.
